## Why This Project?
The primary goal is to create a simple 2D streamer APK for the Meta Quest (and other Android devices).

On the Meta Quest, this allows you to mirror your PC display as a 2D panel that can be used alongside other apps. This is ideal for multitasking—letting you check your desktop, follow a guide, or manage background tasks without leaving VR.

This project is intended for local network use only, assuming your keyboard and mouse remain connected to the host PC.
